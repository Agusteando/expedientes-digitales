# Next.js + Prisma + Tailwind SaaS Starter

A starter template leveraging [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for fast, scalable SaaS development. Design is fully responsive and font-first with [Geist Sans](https://vercel.com/fonts/geist) and [Geist Mono](https://vercel.com/fonts/geist-mono).

## Features

- Next.js App Router with server- and client-components
- Tailwind CSS with mobile-first, gap-based layouts
- Fully responsive, accessible foundational UI
- Prisma ORM for type-safe database access
- Easy deploy with Vercel (see Deploy button on homepage)
- Readable, maintainable code, DRY structure

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   
2. **Setup your environment:**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in variables
   - Configure a PostgreSQL (or other) database for Prisma

3. **Run the database migrations:**
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```

4. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser**

## Deployment

Ready for deployment on Vercel. Click the "Deploy now" button on the homepage or run:
```bash
vercel
```

## Structure

- `app/` — Next.js App Router pages & layouts
- `components/` — Shared, reusable React components
- `lib/` — Utility helpers and Prisma client
- `prisma/` — Prisma schema and migrations
- `public/` — Static files, SVGs, and images

## Customization

- Typography is controlled via Geist fonts (see `app/layout.js`)
- Tailwind config enables design tokens and overrides (see `tailwind.config.js`)
- All UI is responsive, never using fixed px units
